I love working with startups and scale-ups on interesting product and
engineering challenges. My specialty is **full-stack web development**, with
senior level experience using **Go**, **TypeScript** (Node.js), **React** and
**Svelte**. I deliver pragmatic _and_ high quality solutions on a deadline.

Curious how I can add value to your team as a **Freelance Software Engineer**?
